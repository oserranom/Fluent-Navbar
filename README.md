# Fluent Navbar

In this project, I wanted to create a navigation bar with dropdowns and responsive web design functionality. The main idea was to work with dynamic dropdowns that respond to the hover event and, starting from a certain breakpoint, have the navigation replaced by a menu button that would display the navigation vertically while maintaining the dropdown functionality with the hover event.
